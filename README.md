# Events App

## Project Overview
The **Events App** is a React-based application designed to allow users to search, create, edit, and delete events while categorizing them into different themes. This project was built as part of my React Advanced course with the goal of practicing key concepts such as data fetching, routing, navigation, form handling, event handling, error handling, and responsive design.

## Technologies Used
- React
- React Router

## Features
- Data fetching: Handling API calls for creating, editing, and deleting events.
- Search functionality: Filter events by title or category (sports, games, art, etc.) in real time.
- Form handling: Managing form inputs, validations, and controlled components for event creation and editing.
- Error handling: Displaying error messages when data fetching fails or an action cannot be completed.
- Responsive design: Works smoothly across desktop and mobile devices.
